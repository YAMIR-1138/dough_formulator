# DOUGH_FORMULATOR

**"Calculate. Ferment. Ascend."**

`DOUGH_FORMULATOR` is a side project — a retro-inspired sourdough calculator built for hydration nerds, ratio tinkerers, and spreadsheet-weary bakers. It's designed for clarity, control, and just a hint of galactic flair.

This is an ongoing project I'm making for fun, so parts of it may be unfinished, buggy, or fully operational by accident.
